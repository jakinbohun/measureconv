MeasureConversion is a personal project derived from my joy of cooking.

The purpose of this Java program is to perform measurement conversions between the popular measurement types used in cooking.

Of note:
- I converted the Rational file from Python to Java
- Built measurement conversions off of mixed number operations

My goal with this project is to incorporate data structures from my coursework while creating an efficient application.
